            <div class="para">
            <p>An unquenchable thirst for innovation and disruption; a rich legacy of technology and entrepreneurship; and a commitment to nurturing leaders who make a difference to the world has been the credo of BIT Mesra in the nearly six decades of its existence </p>
            <p>It has many firsts to its credit. It was the first in the country to establish a department dedicated to Space Engineering & Rocketry way back in 1964. It was also the first to develop a Science & Technology Entrepreneursâ€™ Park (BIT-STEP), on campus to instill the spirit of entrepreneurship in its students. Today, it is a vibrant place, bustling with student activities and innovative teaching methods that make it home to thousands of aspiring leaders of tomorrow.</p>
